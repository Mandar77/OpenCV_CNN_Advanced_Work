# Real-Time Panorama Creation Using Live Camera

This project involves developing a real-time application using Python and OpenCV to capture a sequence of images from a live camera and create a panoramic photo. The application uses ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) for feature detection and matching.

## Project Overview

The application captures frames from the webcam when the user presses the 's' key and stops capturing when the 'a' key is pressed. It then stitches the captured frames into a panorama using feature-based image alignment.

## Features

- Real-time video capture from webcam
- ORB feature detection and matching
- Image stitching to create panoramas
- Multithreaded video capture for reduced lag
